# Proper Flanking 2

This is a mod for Pathfinder: Kingmaker that replaces original game flanking mechanics to that of pnp pathfinder.

It also adds soft cover mechanics (can be disabled in your_game_folder/Mods/ProperFlanking/settings.json) and few related feats:
- Phalanx Formation
- Low Profile
- Quick Draw
- Pack Flanking
- Gang Up
- Enfilading Fire
- Friendly Fire Maneuvers
- Improved Feint
- Greater Feint
- Ranged Feint
- Swordplay Style and Swordplay Upset
- Wild Flanking
- Two-Weapon Feint and Improved Two-Weapon Feint
- Quick Dirty Trick
- Dirty Fighting

New Rogue Talents:
- Underhanded Trick

It also adds option to use combat maneuvers as attack (although in a bit lighter way than Closer To Tabletop - only first attack can be replaced and only during full attack action).
In addition, when using Trip, Disarm, Sunder or Dirty Trick Maneuvers with Quick Dirty Trick feat CMB will be calculated based on weapon used for maneuver (primary hand weapon if used outside of full attack).

It is not compatible with Closer To Tabletop mod, but it can replace it without breaking your saves.
It requires at least Call of the Wild 1.54.
