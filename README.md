# Proper Flanking 2

This is a mod for Pathfinder: Kingmaker that replaces original game flanking mechanics to that of pnp pathfinder.

It also adds soft cover mechanics (can be disabled in your_game_folder/Mods/ProperFlanking/settings.json) and few related feats:
- Phalanx Formation
- Low Profile
- Quick Draw
- Pack Flanking
- Paired Opportunists
- Gang Up

New Rogue Talents:
- Underhanded Trick

It also adds option to use combat maneuvers as attacks.
In addition, when using Trip, Disarm, Sunder, Bull Rush (as a part of charge) or Dirty Trick combat maneuvers (as part of full attack with Quick Dirty Trick feat) CMB will be calculated based on weapon used for maneuver (primary hand weapon if used outside of full attack).

It is not compatible with Closer To Tabletop mod, but it can replace it without breaking your saves.
It requires at least Call of the Wild 1.77.
